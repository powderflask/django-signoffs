"""
A "Stamp of Approval" is the persistence layer that backs an Approval - the timestamp that seals the Approval.
    - often models the set of related Signets that define the Approval's "Signing Order".
A concrete Stamp may have other information about, or perhaps a relation to, the thing being approved.

A Stamp records status of an Approval, and is often automated by business logic defining when the Approval is complete.
An approved Stamp record provides evidence that a particular Approval was granted and by whom (via signatories).
A Stamp may be granted directly if business rules dictate, but normally is granted via one or more Signets.
Otherwise, a Stamp is not ordinarily edited directly - add and revoke Signets to move it through its signing order.
Once granted, the Stamp persists its "approved" status, regardless of the state of underlying Signets or
    changes to the Approval process.
To revoke a Stamp, we alter the approval status and revoke the Signet(s) used to grant the Approval.
A "blame" history, may be maintained by using a RevokeSignet model on the Approval Type.
