"""
Forms for collecting and revoking signoffs.

Challenges:
 - the `Signet` form itself is just a labelled checkbox - it doesn't display any model fields.
   Yet, it should behave like a model form, defining a signoff instance once validated.
 - the form is only displayed when there is no instance - you can't edit a saved signoff, only revoke it.
   So these forms don't have an instance - they are only used to "add" a signoff.
 - the form itself likely needs an association to the Signoff Type so it can be rendered correctly.
 - so, the signoff type itself might be obtained from the request data (e.g., in a generic view)
   So if the request is bad, it may not be possible to construct a Form class to validate rest of data.

Signets with relations:
The form is being used to sign off on something specific, so it likely needs a relation to some concrete object.
So the view will need some way to know which object is being signed off on.

To solve this for concrete `Signets` with relational fields, try ONE of these approaches:
  - pre-create the signoff instance, with relations in place, and pass it to the form.
    The `Signet` instance, with its relations, will be saved if form validates and is signed.
  - specialize `AbstractSignoffForm` to add hidden fields with the extra relation data;
    Use initial data to populate these fields and
    be sure to override `clean()` to validate the extra data.
