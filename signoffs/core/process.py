"""
    Classes, Descriptors, and decorators for coordinating state transitions driven by an Approval Process
    Used to manage a multi-state approval process where state transitions are triggered by Approvals.
    Core responsibility: ensure integrity / consistency of approval state and state transitions

    A "transition" is just a method on your process model that manages a single state transition.
    An "approval transition" is a transition that is dependent on an Approval being approved or revoked.

    Transitions handle side-effects.  Generally, decorators, like django_fsm.transition, are used to perform
        any state transitions (like approvals or revokes), and like django_fsm, these state changes must be
        saved to the DB as a separate step after a successful transition is made.
        See convenience methods BasicApprovalProcess.try_*_transition for examples of how to correctly compelte a transition.

    django-fsm integration:
        - FSMApprovalProcess enforces FSM logic withing the BasicApprovalProcess API
        - FSMApprovalProcessDescriptor provides a declarative syntax for defining an FSM Approval Process
